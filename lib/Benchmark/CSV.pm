=head1 NAME

Benchmark::CSV - Report raw timing results in CSV-style format for advanced processing.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001000

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Benchmark::CSV;

  my $benchmark = Benchmark::CSV->new(
    output => './test.csv',
    sample_size => 10,
  );

  $benchmark->add_instance( 'method_a' => sub {});
  $benchmark->add_instance( 'method_b' => sub {});

  $benchmark->run_iterations(100_000);

=head1 RATIONALE.

I've long found all the other benchmarking utilities well meaning, but easily confusing.

My biggest misgiving is that they give you one, or two values which it has decided is "the time" your code took,
whether its an average, a median, or some other algorithm, ( Such as in C<Benchmark::Dumb> ), they all amount to basically giving you a data point, which you have to take for granted.

That data point may also change wildly between test runs due to computer load or other factors.

Essentially, the flaw as I see it, is trying to convey what is essential a I<spectrum> of results as a single point.

They also run each test sequentially, as in:

  start testing ->

    start test one -> 

    <-- end test one

    record data

    start test one -> 

     <-- end test one

     record data

  <-- stop testing.

And that strikes me as incredibly prone to the batches getting different results due to CPU loading variations,
such that, any benchmark run on this way on anything other than a perfectly idle processor
without so much as an init subsystem stealing CPU time, and with your kernel delivering IO 
perfectly the whole time.

And the final numbers don't really seem to take that into consideration. 

C<Benchmark::Dumb> at least gives you variation data, but its rather hard to compare and visualise the results it gives to gain meaningful insight.

So, I looked to modelling the data differently, and happened to accidentally throw some hand-collected benchmark data into a Google Spreadsheet Histogram plot, and found it hugely enlightening on what was really going on.

One recurring observation I noticed is code runtime seems to have a very lop-sided distribution

Which suggests to me, that unlike many things people usually use statitics for,
where you have a bunch of things evenly on both sides of the mode, code has an I<inherent> mininum run time,
which you might see if your system has all factors in "ideal" conditions, and it has a closely following I<sub-optimal> but I<common> run time, which I imagine you see because the system can't deliver every cycle of code
in perfect situations every time, even the kernel is selfish and says "Well, if I let your code have exactly 100% CPU for as long as you wanted it, I doubt even kernel space would be able to do anything till you were quite done" 
So observing the minimum time C<AND> the median seem to me, useful for comparing algorithm efficiency.

Observing the maximums is useful too, 

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<add_instance>

Add a test block.

  ->add_instance( name => sub { } );

B<NOTE:> You can only add test instances prior to executing the tests.

After executing tests, the number of columns and the column headings become C<finalized>.

This is because of how the CSV file is written in parallel with the test batches.

CSV is written headers first, top to bottom, one column at a time.

So adding a new column is impossible after the headers have been written without starting over.

=head2 C<new>

Create a benchmark object.

  my $instance = Benchmark::CSV->new( \%hash );
  my $instance = Benchmark::CSV->new( %hash  );

  %hash = {
    sample_size => # number of times to call each sub in a sample
    output      => # A file path to write to
    output_fh   => # An output filehandle to write to
  };

=head2 C<sample_size>

The number of times to call each sub in a "Sample".

A sample is a block of timed code.

For instance:

  ->sample_size(4);
  ->add_instance( x => $y );
  ->run_iterations(40);

This will create a timer block similar to below.

  my $start = time();
  # Unrolled, because benchmarking indicated unrolling was faster.
  $y->();
  $y->();
  $y->();
  $y->();
  return time() - $start;

That block will then be called 10 times ( 40 total code executions batched into 10 groups of 4 )
and return 10 time values.

=head3 get:C<sample_size>

  my $size = $bench->sample_size;

Value will default to 1 if not passed during construction.

=head3 set:C<sample_size>

  $bench->sample_size(10);

Can be performed at any time prior, but not after running tests.

=head2 C<output_fh>

An output C<filehandle> to write very sloppy C<CSV> data to.

Results will be in Columns, sorted by column name alphabetically.

C<output_fh> defaults to C<*STDOUT>, or opens a file passed to the constructor as C<output> for writing.

=head3 get:C<output_fh>

  my $fh = $bench->output_fh;

Either *STDOUT or an opened C<filehandle>.

=head3 set:C<output_fh>

  $bench->output_fh( \*STDERR );

Can be set at any time prior, but not after, running tests.

=head2 C<run_iterations>

Executes the attached tests C<n> times in batches of L<< C<sample_size>|/sample_size >>.

  ->run_iterations( 10_000_000 );

Because of how it works, simply spooling results at the bottom of the data file, you can call this method
multiple times as necessary and inject more results.

For instance, this could be used to give a progress report.

  *STDOUT->autoflush(1);
  print "[__________]\r[";
  for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
    $bench->run_iterations( 1_000_000 );
    print "#";
  }
  print "]\n";

This is also how you can do timed batches:

  my $start = [gettimeofday];
  # Just execute as much as possible until 10 seconds of wallclock pass.
  while( tv_interval( $start, [ gettimeofday ]) < 10 ) {
    $bench->run_iterations( 1_000 );
  }
